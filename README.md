# Holochain Open-Dev Blog

Visit the blog: https://holochain-open-dev.github.io.

This is a small blog intended for holochain developers, from the holochain open-dev community. 

This is not maintained by the holochain core team, but rather experienced hApps developers that want to share best practices with one another.

This is intended to be a collaborative effort and go through iterations and feedback from all the devs in the community (thus this git repository), so if you have some feedback or contributions around the articles please make a PR or ping us to add you to the contributors of the repo.
